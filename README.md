### Linear Regression

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data points.
It is used to find the line of best fit, by minimising the sum of mean square errors by recursively performing gradient descent.

**Accuracy: **
**Hyperparameters: **


### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression models the data using the sigmoid function. It is used as a classification algorithm. 
Here, it is used for multinomial classification (10 classes).

**Accuracy: **
**Hyperparameters: **
*Learning Rate: *
*Number of Epochs: *

### K Nearest Neighbours Algorithm

KNN is a model that classifies data points based on the points that are most similar to it.  
The algorithm works by finding the Euclidean distance between the mathematical values of these point

**Accuracy: **
**Hyperparameters: **


### Neural Network
 
A neural network functions when some input data is fed to it. 
This data is then processed via layers of perceptrons to produce the desired output.
This project involves a 4 layered network, with 2 hidden layers. Each hidden layer possesses 16 nodes.

**Accuracy: **
**Hyperparameters: **
