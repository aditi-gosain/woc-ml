### Linear Regression

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data points.
It is used to find the line of best fit, by minimising the sum of mean square errors by recursively performing gradient descent.

**Accuracy: 62.03%**<br/>
**Hyperparameters:**<br/>
Learning Rate: 0.001<br/>
Number of Epochs: 6000


### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression models the data using the sigmoid function. It is used as a classification algorithm. 
Here, it is used for multinomial classification (10 classes).

**Accuracy: 97.739%**<br/>
**Hyperparameters:**<br/>
Learning Rate: 0.000009<br/>
Number of Epochs: 3500


### K Nearest Neighbours Algorithm

KNN is a model that classifies data points based on the points that are most similar to it.  
The algorithm works by finding the Euclidean distance between the mathematical values of these point

**Accuracy: 95.92%**<br/>
**Hyperparameters:**<br/>
K: 5


### Neural Network
 
A neural network functions when some input data is fed to it. 
This data is then processed via layers of perceptrons to produce the desired output.

**Accuracy: 10.10%**<br/>
**Hyperparameters:**<br/>
Number of hidden layers: 2<br/>
Number of nodes per layer: 16<br/>
Learning rate: 0.0009<br/>
Number of Epochs: 500
