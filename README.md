**Linear Regression**

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data points.
It is used to find the line of best fit, by minimising the sum of mean square errors by recursively performing gradient descent.


**Logistic Regression**

Logistic regression models the data using the sigmoid function. It is used as a classification algorithm.
